Dear Admissions Committee,

I am writing to recommend Hannah Brown for your medical school program. As a dermatologist practicing in Denver, Colorado, I have had the privilege of working closely with Hannah for approximately eight months, during which time she served as my medical assistant in a private practice setting. From our initial meeting, I have consistently been impressed by Hannah's exceptional qualities and dedication to both her professional development and the well-being of our patients.

Hannah has a remarkable desire for growth, evident in her proactive approach to seeking feedback and implementing constructive criticism to enhance her skills. Within only a few weeks of working with me, she was able to gather and present a thorough history of present illness, summarize complicated medical histories, and effortlessly document a variety of patient encounters.

Furthermore, Hannah possesses a thirst for knowledge and a genuine desire to share her learnings with others. She frequently took the initiative to delve deeper into various dermatological diagnoses, often researching cases independently and sharing her findings with our team. Even after her time with us concluded, she would continue to share relevant articles and insights with me. For example, she sent me an article about an emerging resistant fungus called Trichophyton indotineae, knowing it may help in my ability to treat complicated cases of tinea corporis.

Hannah's compassion for our patients was evident in her interactions with individuals suffering from severe dermatologic conditions. One of these conditions is Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) which presents with painful skin nodules that can significantly affect a patientâ€™s quality of life. Hannah was instrumental in helping care for one of our patients with HS. She provided a listening ear, tried to understand the pain the patient was experiencing, and helped to refer her to a pain specialist. Many patients took the extra time to praise Hannah for her compassionate care.

Additionally, Hannah's resourcefulness and problem-solving skills were invaluable. She would go above and beyond to ensure our patients received the support they needed, whether it involved assisting with difficult-to-obtain prescriptions or advocating for patients to access necessary medications.

As a member of our team, Hannah proved herself to be a valuable asset and an exemplary team player. She collaborated effectively with her colleagues, demonstrating a positive attitude and a willingness to pitch in wherever needed.

In conclusion, I have the utmost confidence in Hannah's ability to excel in medical school. Thank you for considering Hannah's application. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.

Sincerely,

Channing Hood, MD
