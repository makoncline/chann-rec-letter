<notes>
- Comes to work every day with a smile on her face and enthusiasm for learning
- She takes direction and constructive criticism well. She always asks what she can
improve on and strives to be better at her job.
- Even though it wasn’t a part of her job requirement, she would be inquisitive and curious
about why a patient was diagnosed with a certain condition and how that condition could
be treated
- She keeps her cool in what might be stressful situations such as when a patient was
bleeding excessively or if a patient was unhappy or frustrated
- She worked well in a team setting and with other medical assistants
- She has a genuinely caring personality. She cares about getting to know the patients
outside of their medical condition. She would make conversation with patients during
cutaneous surgery to help distract them from a somewhat uncomfortable procedure
- From early on, she went above and beyond what was expected of her as a first time
medical assistant including calling patients to tell them of a skin cancer diagnosis and
prognosis and helping with insurance prior authorizations even when it wasn’t asked of
her.
- She transitioned seamlessly from working with my team which mostly treats medical
dermatology to working with a Mohs surgery team showing she can adapt to different
clinical environments and different team dynamics.

Dear Admissions Committee,

I am writing to recommend Kate for your nursing program. Kate joined our team with a lot of energy and a keen interest in learning. She quickly showed she’s great with patients, making them feel calm and cared for, even when things get busy or stressful. She even takes the extra time and effort to get to know them and cares about treating the person they are and not just a disease.

Kate always looks for ways to do more and goes above and beyond. She often takes extra steps to help patients understand their treatments and to make everyone’s job easier. She’s good at working with different teams and quickly adapts to new challenges and work environments. For example, she was recently asked to transition from general dermatology to surgical dermatology, a very different subspecialty, and has done so seamlessly and with enthusiasm.

Her kind nature, combined with her strong ability to understand medical information quickly, makes me believe she will be an excellent nurse. Kate is dedicated to getting better and helping patients in a meaningful way, which I think will make her stand out in your program.

Thank you for considering her. I fully support Kate’s move into nursing, confident she’ll contribute a lot to the profession.

Sincerely,

Channing Hood, MD
