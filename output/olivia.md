Olivia has been working as a medical assistant in my clinic for 5 months

She is applying for degree in clinical psychology

She went to Brown University and got a bachelorâ€™s degree in psychology demonstrating her commitment to the field

As a medical assistant, she has been very hard working, often showing up to work early and staying later than most other workers to ensure patients are fully taken care of

During full body skin exams, olivia often finds a way to connect with patients and is genuinely interested in their lives and background and does a great job of trying to take their mind off the stress of getting skin cancer screening

She understands the importance of treating people and not just their disease

She works hard to get patients important medications to heal their skin disease even if it takes making a few extra phone calls to get the medication covered or by working with patient assistance programs to ensure patients get their medication for a reasonable cost

Olivia works well in a team setting. She gets along with everyone she works with and has a knack for communicating with others.

When we are having a stressful day or have a difficult patient encounter, Olivia has a positive attitude and gives me positive reinforcement which often helps me get through the rest of the day

She has great work-life balance, working 4-5 days per week with me while also finding time to go to concerts, spend time with her family, and run half marathons.

Dear Admissions Committee,

I am writing to recommend Olivia for your clinical psychology program. As a dermatologist in private practice, I have worked with Olivia as my medical assistant for the past five months, during which time her exceptional performance led to her promotion to lead medical assistant. Her psychology degree from Brown University and her hands-on experience in patient care make her an excellent fit for your program.

Olivia has a special gift for connecting with patients. During skin cancer screenings, which can be stressful for patients, she naturally puts them at ease through genuine conversation and caring attention. I have particularly noticed her skill in supporting patients diagnosed with chronic conditions like atopic dermatitis and hidradenitis suppurativa, where she offers kind words and encouragement to help them cope with their diagnosis. This ability to handle sensitive situations while supporting patients' emotional needs shows she's well-suited for a career in clinical psychology.

What impresses me most is how Olivia sees beyond just the medical issues. She understands that good healthcare means caring for the whole person. She regularly goes the extra mile for our patients, whether it's making additional calls to insurance companies or finding medication assistance programs to help make treatments more affordable.

In our busy practice, Olivia stands out as a true team player. She works well with everyone and brings a positive attitude that helps us all get through challenging days. Her communication skills and ability to handle stressful situations calmly have made her invaluable to our team.

I've also noticed how well Olivia balances her work and personal life. While giving her all at work, she makes time for running half marathons, enjoying concerts, and spending time with family. This kind of balance and self-awareness is essential for success in mental health care.

Based on her academic background, practical experience, and natural ability to connect with and help others, I strongly believe Olivia will excel in your clinical psychology program. Please feel free to contact me if you need any additional information.

Sincerely,

Channing Hood, MD
